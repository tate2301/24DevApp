# Technologies

- Firebase
- React Native Appearance
- Expo - Used Expo because I was developing on a Windows machine and testing on an iOS device therefore Expo Go came in Handy

# Notes

- The "Continue" button onPress method was ignored as it added one more unnecessary step to the user journey. Instead when the user selects a word from the list, the "Check answer" button shows and they can press it to check their answer and proceed.
